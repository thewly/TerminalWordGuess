# TerminalWordGuess

This is a word guess game that's run completly in your Terminal or Console.

The words are an array of Student and Teacher names from our Cohort.

To start the game use "node index.js". 

When prompted to "guess a letter you think is in the word", type your letter you want to guess then hit enter.

In terminal it will display the word. If a letter hasn't been guessed then it will display an underscore. If a letter in the word has been guessed, it will display the character. If someone inputs a character that's not in the word, in addition to reducing the 'guesses' count, it will display that incorrect letter when you are prompted to guess again.

Once you have correctly guessed all the letters in the mystery word, if you hit enter again, it will congratulate you & ask if you'd like to play again. If you select 'yes', the game will start over with a rematch message. If you select 'no' the game will thank you for playing & reset.
